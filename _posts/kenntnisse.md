History of me and programming
-----------------------------

It all started when my dad, who is a toolmaker, brought home one of the
programshe wrote for the CNC milling machine at his work. It was a program to
make some polygon with rounded corners, printed out together with a picture of
the result. I was very interested in understanding how that was done, but my
dad said it was too complicated for a 7 year old child. He was right, but since
that day I wanted to know how to teach a machine how to do things.

The next contact with programming was when my cousin had a programming course
at scool and showed me what print, input and if can do in a QBasic interpreter.
I was 14 years old and no longer too young to understand what was going on. I
wanted to try what I had seen, but my dad didn't want me to break his new 486 -
he already had felt too much pain trying his own adjustments to autoexec.bat,
config.sys and BIOS configs. A few days later I got my own 386 and the freedom
to break it as often and hard as I want.

I spend many hours every day learning QBasic from the help pages of the interpreter. After a year there were only few commands that I did not know, I had written hundreds of little programs and was still full of ideas and motivated. Digging deeper and deeper I was reaching the limits of what I was allowed to do by the interpreter. So my wish for my next birthday was a book to learn assembly language. For weeks I anticipated to break the limits of QBasic and do everything I wanted. My parents found no assembly book and gave me a Java book.

I got this 'Learn Java 2 in 21 days' book and - maybe because I was young - I worked through two thirds of the book in this 21 days. I understood the syntax and how to run Java, but I did not really get the idea of object oriented programming. I still was very comfortable in QBasic, so I gave Java a rest.
